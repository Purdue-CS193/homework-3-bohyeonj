Q2: What does 'git clone' do? 
It clones the remote (repo) repository to your local computer.

Q3: What does 'git status' do?
it displays the overall frame of staging area and  the current state of your repository including working branches.

Q4: What does "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'" tell you?
It is basically telling me the your local repo branche is in the same page or commit as the master central repo. 

Q5: You’ve made a change to a file in GitHub, the one on the browser, and now you run 'git status' on the terminal. It still says "Up to Date" despite the change. What command do you need to enter first?
you need to enter git fetch first
Q6: You’ve just ran the 'rm' command and deleted an important file. All your code is deleted, not including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit' before the rogue command. Is your code saved?
Your code is saved if you used the push command before you deleted the file but since you only used add and commit command, it is not saved.

Q7: Your computer crashes and all your code is deleted, including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit'. Is your code saved?
Your code is not saved because you didn't run git push command.
